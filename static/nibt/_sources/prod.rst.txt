Production usage

Guide for Operator usage for Production.


Basic checks
------------

#. Ensure that the correct recipe is loaded. (1) Load recipe using the `File` menu.
   (2) Use the UI to ensure that the correct recipe name and version is loaded.

    2 steps to check recipe

#. Input in the lot name into the `Lot name` entry field. Illegal characters are not
   allowed (i.e. `!@#$%^&*`). Click on `OPEN LOT`.

    .. figure:: _images/lot_entry.png

#. Load the DUT. Input `SerialNumber` entry field. Illegal characters are not
   allowed (i.e. `!@#$%^&*`). Click on `START` to trigger test.

#. Example of a successful test

       :alt: test_screenshot
       :align: center
       :width: 650px

    #. Right hand side of the UI will display the current running lotname, and
       the last tested SerialNumber will be displayed.

    #. Lot run statistics (unique DUTs, total number of tests, number of unique
       DUTs that passed, number of unique DUTs that failed) will also be displayed
       on the RHS.

    #. To perform a retest, unload the DUT and load the DUT again. Instead of re-entering
       the same SerialNumber again, you can simply press the `Retest` button.

    #. Details on the PASS/FAIL test results will be displayed in the log. You can
       see which are the parameters that failed and the corresponding test specs.

    #. Test run time is also displayed in the log.



Viewing results
---------------

#. Details on working directory (`Open Local` button)

.. figure:: _images/working_dir.png

#. `_configurations`

    Contains recipes and parameteric definitions.

#. `01-DataCSV`

    Contains the output `TestDatalog.csv` upon end lot

#. `02-WorkingDatalog_TDMS`

    Vontains working data files in TDMS format
    during the lot running. In case of PC/OS/Software crash, you can resume
    back the lot by `Open Lot` with the same lot name. The app will perform
    smart checking using the existing working data files to resume the lot run.

#. `03-WorkingDatalog_CSV`

    Working with CSV file is an incredibly inefficient method.
    However, we recognise that it is an easy way for people to view the data. This
    folder will contain a snapshot of the working data file (TDMS) in CSV format.
    This folder will automatically be rolled over / cleared of old files.

#. `04-Logfiles`

    Each DUT will be logged individually. Visit the here to debug
    by DUT-test hardware level.

#. `05-ArchiveDatalog`

    All working data files in TDMS format will be automatically
    archived into this folder during `End Lot`. Nicely archived into folders by date
    and lotname
