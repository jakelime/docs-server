Getting Started
===============

NIBT is easy to be installed. Distributable is released
with easy to use step-by-step installer for Windows.


Pre-requisites
--------------

- Hardware Requirements
    - NI PXI Modular System
    - Controller: PXIe-8840/8135, etc.
    - SMU Cards: PXIe-4139/4140, etc.

- Software Driver Requirements
    - > nidcpower 20.0.0

    .. note::

      Lower versions of nidcpower might work, but I will not bother
      to support. Critical function we need is Create_Advanced_Sequence,
      and support for 10us from nidcpower 18.5 and above.

    .. warning::

      NI has completely stopped support for Win7 (from nidcpower 20.5.0 onwards)

- Operating System Requirements
    - Hardware 8840/8135 comes preinstalled with OS,
    - Win7 [Version 6.1.7601]
    - Win10 [Version 10.0.19044.2006]

    .. warning::

      Win7 is OFFICIALLY OUT OF SUPPORT. It will be
      incredibly difficult to set up, even though it is possible.
      This version of NIBT is specifically made to support win7,
      but be warned that future feature upgrades / supports will
      not be possible.

- Other Special Requirements

    - Windows 7, SP1, KB4490628
    - Depending on how outdated your win7 is, you need to check and make
      sure the OS is capable of SHA256 certificate signing.

Quickstart
----------

#. Download the *installer.exe*. Open with administrative permissions.

#. Follow the setup instructions. Recommended to install in `C:/Programs Files (x86)` folder,
   this will ensure that any standard user (for *Operator*) can execute the app.

#. Allow the app to access *My Documents* folder (in case there are security prompts)

#. If the app loads successfully, you will be able to see the screenhot below
